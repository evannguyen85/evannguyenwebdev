      My name is Evan. I am a web developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      10 years ago, I started my professional career as a Production Engineer working in a computer chip making factory.
      I love coding. During the time at Intel, I always looked for opportunities to code and automate my routine jobs.
      I decided to become a professional software developer, so I joined a software development company.
